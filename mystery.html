            <h4>Summary:</h3>
            <p>Multiple assassins are stuck on a bullet train together, each with their own goals and mysteries to solve.</p>
            <h4>Review</h3>
            <p>THIS BOOK MADE ME FEEL SO SMART! At the same time, it was also really funny. It was fun to try to solve and is an absolute masterpiece. However, it was a bit boring at times. I gave it a 4/5.</p>

            <p>We know it's going to be a bad adaptation when we see hollywood actors play some of the main characters.
                This was bad. But, in a good way. If we don't compare it to the book, it is just another funny action movie.
                I generally could not stop laughing during this, but due to the lack of plot, I give this a 3.5/5.

            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A highschooler decides to solve a 5 year old closed case for her school project.</p>
            <h4>Review:</h4>
            <p>THIS IS SO GOOD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! I listened to this on audio and it was literally perfect. I love this a bit too much lol</p>

            <p>So you know how adaptaions are suppose to be bad and everything? Well, I didn't listen to myself and got my  hopes up way too high. Why? Because EMMA MYERS PLAYS HER UNVVJKHVFBHVHFBH. That was literally the only good part in it. I give it a 3/5.
                <br>
                I wrote a blog about it:

            <h3>The Inheritance Games</h3>
            <h4>By: Jennifer Lynn Barnes</h4>
            <img src = "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ELakTxSZL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg">
            <h4>Summary:</h4>
            <p>A broke highschooler inherits billions of dollars from a random famous old man, but to get it, she has to stay with his grandchildren for a year.</p>
            <h4>Review:</h4>
            <p>Okay, I know this sounds really cheesey. That is also what I thought (ignore how I just finished book 5, all the novellas, 
                and pre-ordered the 6th book). However, once you get over the start of the book, it gets really good! I really want a tv series for it.
                When the author releases books, she always posts cool puzzles that you have to solve to see parts of it early.</p>
