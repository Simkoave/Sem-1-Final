        <h4>By: Brynne Weaver</h4>

        <h4>Summary:</h4>
        <p>Two serial killers who kill murderers fall in love.</p>
        <h4>Review:</h4>
        <p>So... I thought this was a differnt book. I only read it bc I thought it was a different book. I'm a bit dumb. The concept was good, but it sounds like it was written by a middle schooler. 
            People are saying that the author is working with the director from The Lego Movie to turn this into a movie.

        <p>THE VIBES AAAAAAAAA! My friends constantly make fun of me that the only reason I can somewhat play chess is bc of this book
            (and Queens Gambit but I still haven't finished it yet). It was a bit depressing and I felt so sad for the characters. A bit predictable though.

        <p>My friends also made me read this... they said it would get better... it did not get better. 
            Look, the fantasy part and the world building and the politics were GREAT! However, that was some of the worst written romance I have ever read.
            Not to be self-absorbed but I could write better romance than that On the plus side, I did get an A+ on a hate essay I wrote about it..</p>
